Octopus, an open-source code interpreter, enables you to build your own productive tools in minutes, which you can then use in terminals, Discord, and other chat tools.

## Getting Started

## How It works

Core components

* Kernel: The code execution engine, based on notebook kernels.
* Agent: Manages client requests, uses ReAct to process complex tasks, and stores user-assembled applications.
* Chat: Accepts user requests, sends them to the Agent, and renders rich results. Currently supports Discord, iTerm2, and Kitty terminals.

For security, it is recommended to run the kernel and agent as Docker containers.
